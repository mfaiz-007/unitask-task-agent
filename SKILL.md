# Unitask Task Agent

## Purpose

This skill lets an AI agent safely manage a user's Unitask account using **scoped API tokens**.

It supports:
- CLI usage (local terminal)
- MCP clients (local stdio MCP)
- Hosted MCP endpoint (HTTPS via Vercel)

Supported operations:
- List tasks
- Get one task
- Create task
- Update task status
- Delete task (soft delete)
- Read/update settings (optional one-time setup)
- Plan day time blocks (preview/apply time-blocking)

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks for things like:
- "List my tasks / what's next?"
- "Create a task for X"
- "Mark these tasks done"
- "Time-block my day from 9am to 5pm"

## Required setup

1. User creates a Unitask API token from `Unitask -> Dashboard -> Settings -> API`.
2. User stores token locally as `UNITASK_API_KEY` (recommended: `/Users/mfaiz/Developer/unified-repo/unitask/website/.env.local`).
3. Optional base URL override as `UNITASK_API_BASE_URL`.

Never ask users to paste full tokens in chat logs. Ask them to set environment variables instead.

## Scope model

- `read`: required to read/list tasks.
- `write`: create/update tasks.
- `delete`: delete tasks.
- If `write` or `delete` is granted, `read` must also be granted.

## Repo-native commands

From this repository:

```bash
npm run unitask:api -- list --limit 20
npm run unitask:api -- get --id <task_id>
npm run unitask:api -- create --title "Plan today"
npm run unitask:api -- update-status --id <task_id> --status done
npm run unitask:api -- delete --id <task_id>
```

## MCP mode

Start MCP server:

```bash
npm run unitask:mcp
```

Exposed MCP tools:
- `list_tasks`
- `get_task`
- `create_task`
- `update_task_status`
- `delete_task`
- `get_settings`
- `update_settings`
- `plan_day_timeblocks`

Recommended usage for time blocking:
- Call `plan_day_timeblocks` with `apply=false` to preview.
- Only call again with `apply=true` after the user confirms the plan.

## Hosted MCP (HTTPS)

If the Unitask app is deployed (Vercel), an MCP endpoint is available at:

- `https://<your-domain>/api/mcp`

Auth headers (pick one):
- `Authorization: Bearer <UNITASK_API_KEY>` (recommended)
- `X-Unitask-Api-Key: <UNITASK_API_KEY>`

## Safety rules

- Use smallest required scope for the requested action.
- Confirm destructive actions (delete) unless user explicitly asks to proceed.
- Prefer `status=done` over delete when user intent is completion, not removal.
- For `plan_day_timeblocks`, prefer preview (`apply=false`) first; only apply after user confirms.
